We have sey up MITM proxy succesfully. 

Things we have tried so far:
1. Telegram
2. Line
3. Skout

Telegram:
Telegram uses Certificate pinning. So we were not able to see the trafic using mitm proxy. We have few questions about its trafic.

Line:
We were able to see lines trafic with iphone only. With android it does not work. 

SKOUT:
We are able to find precise distance of the people nearby using mitm. We are hopeful about this. 


Nearby:
We can see the distance in this app also. There is some noise in the distance but we can see the distance with MITM. We can see distance both in KM and miles.


Meetme:
We can see the distance with MITM.


We have figured out the limitations of MITM

04/12/2021:

1. Check the distance between Muzzamil and Jyotsna (Skout)
    Observations: 
    1.  Distance is being measured, not the displacement
2. MITM proxy on Line 
    1. Didn't yeild positive results
    2. Has encrypted data
3. MITM proxy on Meetme
    Observations:
    1. Could sucessfully extract the user's location
    2. Checked Muzzamil's location (accurate)
