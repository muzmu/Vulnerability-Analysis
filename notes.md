We have sey up MITM proxy succesfully. 

Things we have tried so far:
1. Telegram
2. Line
3. Skout

Telegram:
Telegram uses Certificate pinning. So we were not able to see the trafic using mitm proxy. We have few questions about its trafic.

Line:
We were able to see lines trafic with iphone only. With android it does not work. 

SKOUT:
We are able to find precise distance of the people nearby using mitm. We are hopeful about this. 


We have figured out the limitations of MITM
