SKOUT:
1. Try 0.6-1.8 distance


MEETME:
1. Check the distance from 0-1.9


Nearby:
1. Check the distance change from 0-1.9


Figure out a way to automate distance update.
 1. Use MITM dump
 2. Write a python script that catches the header
 3. Use asynchronous comand line input which take cordinates
 5. Script Update conrdinates in the header and requestes
 6. Response will be saved in a file.
  
  
We need to find another app vulnerabler apps if SKOUT doesnot give preciese distance.
