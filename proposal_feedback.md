#What is the project

The way I look at the project there are two threats that location spoofing enables:

1. You can learn about people nearby where you really are not (e.g., you're in Boston, see people in Los Angeles)

1. The second aspect is, the "people nearby" feature might (a) give you no location information, or (b) only crude location information about the people nearby. In this case, the interesting question would be can you identify the "precise location" as you write in your introduction of the people nearby.

While the first point above receives some tasks throughout the project, the second point does not. I think the second point is also very important and should deserve attention, tasks, time, and implementation time.

## How do you plan on tackling the project

### ad April 5

"Setup testing environment ..."

Can you be more specific what you'll need there? For example, I don't know why you need a proxy, and the GPS location spoofing mechanism is too vague. I can think of at least two mechanisms off the top of my head. Please be more explicit about that.

"Test if apps detect GPS location spoofing"

If you (a) have 5 apps from Week 1, and (b) can spoof location, why is this a separate task? Would it not merely boil down to run the apps, spoof location and be done. I.e., can easily be done in the same week where the location spoofing is created.


## List of 3 ...

### ad A grade

"Exploit this vulnerabiltiy in 3 apps"

you'll have to come up with a better description of what it means to exploit. The first bullet only assesses whether you can spoof your location. I would consider an exploit successful if it identifys the location of users you should not see nearby (which is not automatically the same as being able to spoof.
